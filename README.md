The Employee Database Management System is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack to manage employee information efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete employee records through an interactive and responsive user interface. This project focuses on implementing real-world CRUD operations and understanding how frontend and backend systems communicate with each other.

The frontend of the application is built using React, where different components are used to handle employee forms and display employee data dynamically. User inputs are managed using React state, and API requests are sent to the backend to perform operations on employee records. The UI is designed to be responsive and easy to use, ensuring smooth interaction while managing employee details.

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, where RESTful APIs handle all employee-related operations. These APIs process incoming requests from the frontend, validate the data, and perform the required actions such as creating, updating, or deleting records. The backend acts as a bridge between the frontend and the database, ensuring proper data flow and error handling.

MongoDB is used as the database to store employee information in a structured document format. Each employee record is stored as a document, allowing efficient data retrieval and modification. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, REST API design, database integration, and building scalable web applications using the MERN stack.
